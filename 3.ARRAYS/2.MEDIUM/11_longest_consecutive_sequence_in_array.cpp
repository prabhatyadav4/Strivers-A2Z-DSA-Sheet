/*
Given an array nums of n integers.

Return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. The integers in this sequence can appear in any order.

Example 1

Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4. This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order of the elements in the array.

Example 2

Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]

Output: 9
